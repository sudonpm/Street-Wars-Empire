# Street Wars: Empire
Street Wars: Empire is my modified version of Streetwars Online 2 Version 1.00 by Wuzzbent. The Original Source Code can be found here:

I added many new things and improved on others.

Back in the early 2000s Wuzzbent was no longer able to host the server for the game and he released the source code for all to use and share.

I got Visual Basics 6 and started modifiying it and adding so much more. It grew to having 20-50 daily users with over 500 registered users. I was around 15 at the time and this code will always hold a special place in my heart.

Sharing this is my way of remembering where things started and also in hopes of finding some of the old players and members of the community as well.
